  abstract     = {In this paper, we present a digital library system for managing heterogeneous music collections. The heterogeneity refers to various document types and formats as well as to different modalities, e. g., CD-audio recordings, scanned sheet music, and lyrics. The system offers a full-fledged, widely automated document processing chain: digitization, indexing, annotation, access, and presentation. Our system is implemented as a generic and modular music repository based on a service-oriented software architecture. As a particular strength of our approach, the various documents representing aspects of a piece of music are jointly considered in all stages of the document processing chain. Our user interfaces allow for a multimodal and synchronized presentation of documents (WYSIWYH: what you see is what you hear), a score- or lyrics-based navigation in audio, as well as a cross- and multimodal retrieval. Hence, our music repository may be called a truly cross-modal library system. In our paper, we describe the system components, outline the techniques of the document processing chain, and illustrate the implemented functionalities for user interaction. We describe how the system is put into practice at the Bavarian State Library (BSB) Munich as a part of the German PROBADO Digital Library Initiative (PDLI).},

abstract = {Graph database models can be defined as those in which data structures for the schema and instances are modeled as graphs or generalizations of them, and data manipulation is expressed by graph-oriented operations and type constructors. These models took off in the eighties and early nineties alongside object-oriented models. Their influence gradually died out with the emergence of other database models, in particular geographical, spatial, semistructured, and XML. Recently, the need to manage information with graph-like nature has reestablished the relevance of this area. The main objective of this survey is to present the work that has been conducted in the area of graph database modeling, concentrating on data structures, query languages, and integrity constraints.},

abstract = {Enterprises have made amazing advances by taking advantage of data about their business to provide predictions and understanding of their customers, markets, and products. But as the world of business becomes more interconnected and global, enterprise data is no long a monolith; it is just a part of a vast web of data. Managing data on a world-wide scale is a key capability for any business today.The Semantic Web treats data as a distributed resource on the scale of the World Wide Web, and incorporates features to address the challenges of massive data distribution as part of its basic design. The aim of the first two editions was to motivate the Semantic Web technology stack from end-to-end; to describe not only what the Semantic Web standards are and how they work, but also what their goals are and why they were designed as they are. It tells a coherent story from beginning to end of how the standards work to manage a world-wide distributed web of knowledge in a meaningful way.The third edition builds on this foundation to bring Semantic Web practice to enterprise. Fabien Gandon joins Dean Allemang and Jim Hendler, bringing with him years of experience in global linked data, to open up the story to a modern view of global linked data. While the overall story is the same, the examples have been brought up to date and applied in a modern setting, where enterprise and global data come together as a living, linked network of data. Also included with the third edition, all of the data sets and queries are available online for study and experimentation at data.world/swwo.}
